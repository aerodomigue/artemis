# Test Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ToolTip Warning Fixed ✅
**Issue**: `QML ApplicationWindow: ToolTip attached property must be attached to an object deriving from Item`
**Fix**: Moved ToolTip attachment from ApplicationWindow to a proper Item component in main.qml

### 2. ClipboardManager Property Binding Fixed ✅
**Issues**: 
- `TypeError: Property 'setEnabled' of object ClipboardManager is not a function`
- `TypeError: Property 'setTextOnlyMode' of object ClipboardManager is not a function`
- `TypeError: Property 'setMaxContentSizeMB' of object ClipboardManager is not a function`
- `TypeError: Property 'setShowNotifications' of object ClipboardManager is not a function`

**Fix**: Changed from calling setter functions to direct property assignment in ClipboardSettings.qml:
- `ClipboardManager.setEnabled(checked)` → `ClipboardManager.isEnabled = checked`
- `ClipboardManager.setTextOnlyMode(checked)` → `ClipboardManager.textOnlyMode = checked`
- `ClipboardManager.setMaxContentSizeMB(value)` → `ClipboardManager.maxContentSizeMB = value`
- `ClipboardManager.setShowNotifications(checked)` → `ClipboardManager.showNotifications = checked`

### 3. Layout Issues Fixed ✅
**Issue**: ServerCommands section was getting cut off and not visible
**Fixes**:
- Removed `clip: true` from both ClipboardSettings and ServerCommands GroupBox components
- Reduced spacing in components to make them more compact
- Added bottom padding to the second column to ensure enough space
- Improved overall layout efficiency

## Files Modified

1. `app/gui/main.qml` - Fixed ToolTip attachment
2. `app/gui/ClipboardSettings.qml` - Fixed property bindings and layout
3. `app/gui/ServerCommands.qml` - Fixed layout and clipping
4. `app/gui/SettingsView.qml` - Improved column spacing and padding

## Expected Results

After these changes:
1. ✅ No more ToolTip warnings in the logs
2. ✅ No more ClipboardManager property binding errors
3. ✅ ServerCommands section should be fully visible and scrollable
4. ✅ Clipboard settings should work properly
5. ✅ Overall settings UI should be more compact and functional

## Testing Steps

1. Build and run the application
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Scroll down to see the "Artemis Features" section
4. Verify that both "Clipboard Sync" and "Server Commands" sections are visible
5. Test clipboard settings toggles and inputs
6. Check that no errors appear in the logs
7. Verify that the ServerCommands buttons are visible and functional

## Next Steps

If the ServerCommands section is still not fully visible, consider:
1. Making the components even more compact
2. Using a ScrollView within the Artemis Features section
3. Reorganizing the layout to use more horizontal space
4. Moving some settings to a separate tab or page
