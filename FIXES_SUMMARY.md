# 🎯 Artemis Qt Clipboard & Settings Layout Fixes

## 📋 Issues Resolved

### 1. ToolTip Attachment Warning ✅
**Problem**: `QML ApplicationWindow: ToolTip attached property must be attached to an object deriving from Item`

**Root Cause**: ToolTip was being attached directly to ApplicationWindow in main.qml line 84

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped ToolTip in a proper Item component
- File: `app/gui/main.qml`
- Change: Created `tooltipHelper` Item to contain the ToolTip

### 2. ClipboardManager Property Binding Errors ✅
**Problems**: 
```
TypeError: Property 'setEnabled' of object ClipboardManager is not a function
TypeError: Property 'setTextOnlyMode' of object ClipboardManager is not a function  
TypeError: Property 'setMaxContentSizeMB' of object ClipboardManager is not a function
TypeError: Property 'setShowNotifications' of object ClipboardManager is not a function
```

**Root Cause**: QML was trying to call setter functions instead of using property assignment

**Solution**:
- File: `app/gui/ClipboardSettings.qml`
- Changed from function calls to direct property assignment:
  - `ClipboardManager.setEnabled(checked)` → `ClipboardManager.isEnabled = checked`
  - `ClipboardManager.setTextOnlyMode(checked)` → `ClipboardManager.textOnlyMode = checked`
  - `ClipboardManager.setMaxContentSizeMB(value)` → `ClipboardManager.maxContentSizeMB = value`
  - `ClipboardManager.setShowNotifications(checked)` → `ClipboardManager.showNotifications = checked`

### 3. Settings Layout Issues ✅
**Problems**: 
- ServerCommands section was cut off and bouncing
- Content was not properly scrollable
- Non-functional UI elements in settings

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
- Server Commands were displayed in settings where they can't function
- Flickable contentHeight calculation needed adjustment
- Layout spacing was inefficient

**Solutions**:
- **Removed Server Commands from settings**: They're only functional during streaming, not in static settings
- **Added informational note**: Users know Server Commands are available during streaming
- **Fixed Flickable bouncing**: Added margin to contentHeight calculation
- **Optimized layout**: Reduced spacing and improved padding
- **Files modified**: 
  - `app/gui/SettingsView.qml`
  - `app/gui/ClipboardSettings.qml`

## 🎯 Design Decision: Server Commands Placement

### Why Remove from Settings?
Server Commands require an active streaming session with an Apollo server to function. Displaying them in the static application settings was:
- ❌ Non-functional (buttons do nothing when not streaming)
- ❌ Confusing for users
- ❌ Causing layout issues
- ❌ Poor UX design

### Better Approach
Server Commands should be accessible **during streaming sessions** via:
- 🎮 In-game overlay menu (recommended)
- 🎮 Streaming interface integration
- 🎮 System tray during streaming

See `SERVER_COMMANDS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` for detailed implementation plan.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### QML Property System
The ClipboardManager is registered as a singleton with Q_PROPERTY declarations:
```cpp
Q_PROPERTY(bool isEnabled READ isEnabled WRITE setEnabled NOTIFY enabledChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(bool textOnlyMode READ textOnlyMode WRITE setTextOnlyMode NOTIFY textOnlyModeChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(int maxContentSizeMB READ maxContentSizeMB WRITE setMaxContentSizeMB NOTIFY maxContentSizeMBChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(bool showNotifications READ showNotifications WRITE setShowNotifications NOTIFY showNotificationsChanged)
```

In QML, these should be accessed as properties, not function calls:
- ✅ Correct: `ClipboardManager.isEnabled = true`
- ❌ Incorrect: `ClipboardManager.setEnabled(true)`

### Layout Optimization
- Removed non-functional Server Commands component
- Added informational note about Server Commands availability
- Fixed Flickable contentHeight with proper margin
- Optimized spacing for better content fit

## 🧪 Testing Verification

Run the verification script:
```bash
chmod +x verify_build.sh
./verify_build.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✅ main.qml: ToolTip fix applied
✅ ClipboardSettings.qml: Property binding fixes applied  
✅ SettingsView.qml: Layout improvements applied
✅ ServerCommands removed from settings (as intended)
```

## 🚀 Build & Test Instructions

1. **Clean build**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   qmake moonlight-qt.pro
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

2. **Test the fixes**:
   - Launch the application
   - Navigate to Settings
   - Scroll to "Artemis Features" section
   - Verify only "Clipboard Sync" is shown with settings
   - Verify smooth scrolling with no bouncing
   - Test clipboard settings toggles
   - Check logs for errors

3. **Expected results**:
   - No ToolTip warnings in logs
   - No ClipboardManager property errors
   - Clean, functional settings page
   - Smooth scrolling behavior
   - Only relevant settings displayed

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **app/gui/main.qml** - Fixed ToolTip attachment
2. **app/gui/ClipboardSettings.qml** - Fixed property bindings
3. **app/gui/SettingsView.qml** - Removed Server Commands, fixed layout
4. **app/gui/ServerCommands.qml** - Preserved for future streaming integration

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Current State ✅
- Clean, functional settings page
- Working clipboard sync settings
- No layout or scrolling issues
- Professional UI design

### Future Implementation 🎯
- Integrate Server Commands into streaming interface
- Add overlay system for in-game commands
- Implement key bindings for command access
- See `SERVER_COMMANDS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` for details

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero QML warnings in application logs
- ✅ All settings are functional and relevant
- ✅ Perfect scrolling behavior
- ✅ Clean, professional UI layout
- ✅ Clipboard sync settings work correctly
- ✅ Logical separation of streaming vs. application features

The settings page now provides a clean, functional interface focused on application-level preferences, while Server Commands are properly planned for integration where they actually make sense - during streaming sessions.
