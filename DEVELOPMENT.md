  - [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

### 📋 Key Findings from Artemis Android Analysis

#### Clipboard Sync Implementation
- **HTTP Endpoints**: Uses `actions/clipboard` endpoint with `type=text` parameter
- **Methods**: `getClipboard()` and `sendClipboard(content)` in NvHTTP.java
- **Protocol**: Simple HTTP GET/POST to Apollo server
- **Smart Sync**: Automatic sync on stream start/resume and focus loss
- **Identifier**: Uses `CLIPBOARD_IDENTIFIER` to avoid sync loops
- **Settings**: `smartClipboardSync`, `smartClipboardSyncToast`, `hideClipboardContent`

#### OTP Pairing Implementation  
- **Protocol**: Extends standard PIN pairing with `&otpauth=` parameter
- **Hash**: SHA-256 hash of `pin + saltStr + passphrase`
- **UI**: 4-digit PIN input, only available with Apollo servers
- **Flow**: Standard pairing flow but with OTP authentication instead of PIN display

#### Server Commands Implementation
- **Permission**: Requires `server_cmd` permission from Apollo server
- **UI**: Menu option "Server Commands" in game menu
- **Error Handling**: Shows dialog if no commands available or permission denied
- **Apollo Only**: Feature only works with Apollo server software

#### Permission System
- **Enum**: `ComputerDetails.Operations` defines permission flags
- **Flags**: `clipboard_set`, `clipboard_read`, `file_upload`, `file_download`, `server_cmd`
- **Check**: Client checks server capabilities before showing features

### 🚧 Phase 2: Core Features Implementation (PLANNED)
- [ ] **Clipboard Sync**
  - [ ] Implement clipboard monitoring
  - [ ] Add network protocol handling
  - [ ] Create bidirectional sync
  - [ ] Add security and size limits
- [ ] **Server Commands**
  - [ ] Implement command execution framework
  - [ ] Add UI for command management
  - [ ] Create command history and favorites
- [ ] **OTP Pairing**
  - [ ] Implement OTP generation and verification
  - [ ] Add enhanced security features
  - [ ] Create user-friendly pairing flow

### 📅 Phase 3: Client-Side Enhancements (FUTURE)
- [ ] **Fractional Refresh Rate Control**
- [ ] **Resolution Scaling Options**
- [ ] **Virtual Display Management**

### 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Features (FUTURE)
- [ ] **Custom App Ordering**
- [ ] **Server Permission Viewing**
- [ ] **Input-Only Mode**

## 📊 Current Status

**Overall Progress**: 40% Complete  
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Integration & Testing  
**Active Development**: Moonlight Qt integration

## 🔍 Research Notes

### Artemis Android Analysis
*Location*: `../artemis-android` (local clone)

**TODO**: Examine the following areas:
- Clipboard sync implementation files
- Server command execution mechanism
- OTP pairing protocol and UI
- Network protocol extensions
- Security and authentication handling

### Key Questions to Answer
1. **Clipboard Sync**: What network protocol is used? How is data formatted and secured?
2. **Server Commands**: What HTTP endpoints are used? How are commands defined and executed?
3. **OTP Pairing**: How does it differ from PIN pairing? What crypto is used?
4. **Apollo Integration**: What server-side changes are required?
